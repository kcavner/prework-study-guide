## Description



- The motivation for this app comes from the question of efficiency and organization in my studies. Efficiency is a key part of what you will find when you examine top-level performers in any field. The ability to group different problems and complete them synchronously rather than sequentially is the dividing line between those that come before others. Another look at top-level performers shows a high level of organization permeated through everything they do, it is a core value of successful people.
- learning to code simply by reading and consuming instruction is a waste of time. If for example, you read an entire textbook on C++ and are asked to create a game, you won't even know where to begin if you had just consumed the instruction. At the very least you will end up with a large list of errors with no clue on how to address them. This app efficiently addresses the need for a hands-on coding project and a good system of note-taking.
- learning how to code isn't a perfectly linear progression, I found myself making notes about git in a section mostly about javascript, etc. The different study topics are separated and now have dedicated lists. No longer am I stumbling around in my notes document looking for git commands.
- I learned a lot technically speaking, like finding the details of type safety in javascript. Type conversion done in compiled languages is completed during compilation, type conversion in javascript is very forgiving because it is a dynamic language (it is done in runtime). This allows for more freedom in type conversion. I have always been curious about arrays because when you think about them, they are in more places than you realize. The power of utilizing arrays is something I have wanted to explore more and it was nice being able to scratch the surface.
- Not only does this app allow for an optimized system of note-taking, the CSS elements also accentuate the organization. Focal points and visual balance is all part of good organization. Getting into the study mindset is more streamlined with this app compared to other apps that don't have good CSS elements.
