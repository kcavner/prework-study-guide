          <li>style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet.</li>
          <li>Inline CSS stlyes elements directly in the HTML file</li>
          <li>Inline CSS is useful for quick and permanent changes however they are not as flexible as external because the editing is less automated</li>
          <li>Internal CSS is more automated because it is located in the head section of the HTML file and can apply stlye to different classes and ids</li>
          <li>external CSS is the most popular way of styling a page because it is more organized than having more bulk in the HTML document</li>
          <li>linking an external CSS file is done by including a link element placed in the HTML's head section</li>
          <li>external css files is related to the separation of concerns it is good design practice</li>
